# 🍎 Apple Stock Price Prediction Plan

## 🎯 Goal
Predict Apple's stock price for tomorrow using OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data with a 3-layer Deep Neural Network.

## 📋 Complete Plan

### Step 1: Setup (Already Done ✅)
- ✅ 3-layer DNN model created (`model.py`)
- ✅ Data fetching system ready (`fetch_data.py`)
- ✅ Prediction script created (`predict_tomorrow.py`)
- ✅ Easy execution script created (`run_prediction.py`)
- ✅ All dependencies checked and working

### Step 2: Execute Prediction
Simply run this command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 run_prediction.py
```

### Step 3: What Happens Automatically
1. **📊 Data Fetching**: Gets latest 2 years of Apple stock data
2. **🤖 Model Training**: Trains the 3-layer DNN for 50 epochs
3. **🔮 Prediction**: Uses last 30 days of OHLCV data to predict tomorrow
4. **📈 Results**: Shows current price, predicted price, and analysis

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Layer 1: Raw Data Processing
- **Type**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Input**: OHLCV data (5 features)
- **Purpose**: Learns patterns from raw stock price movements

### Layer 2: Monthly Integration
- **Type**: Dense layers with ReLU activation
- **Input**: LSTM output + monthly OHLCV averages
- **Purpose**: Integrates short-term and medium-term trends

### Layer 3: Deep Reasoning
- **Type**: Multi-layer perceptron
- **Output**: Single price prediction
- **Purpose**: Final reasoning and price prediction

## 📊 Expected Output

```
🍎 APPLE STOCK PRICE PREDICTION FOR TOMORROW
============================================================
📅 Prediction Date: [Current Date/Time]
📊 Current Price: $[Current Price]
🔮 Predicted Price: $[Predicted Price]
📈 Price Change: $[Change] ([Percentage]%)
📈 Prediction: [BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL]
============================================================
⚠️  DISCLAIMER: This is a machine learning prediction and should not be used as financial advice.
   Always do your own research and consult with financial professionals.
============================================================
```

## 🔧 Alternative Execution Methods

### Method 1: Direct Prediction Script
```bash
python3 predict_tomorrow.py
```

### Method 2: Interactive Python
```python
from predict_tomorrow import ApplePricePredictor
predictor = ApplePricePredictor()
predictor.run_prediction()
```

### Method 3: Custom Parameters
```python
from predict_tomorrow import ApplePricePredictor
predictor = ApplePricePredictor()
predictor.train_model(data, epochs=100)  # More training epochs
predicted_price = predictor.predict_tomorrow()
```

## 📈 Understanding the Prediction

### OHLCV Data Used:
- **Open**: Opening price for each day
- **High**: Highest price during the day
- **Low**: Lowest price during the day
- **Close**: Closing price for each day
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded

### Prediction Logic:
1. Takes last 30 days of OHLCV data
2. Normalizes the data for training
3. Feeds through 3-layer neural network
4. Outputs predicted closing price for tomorrow

### Market Sentiment:
- **BULLISH** (📈): Predicted price > Current price
- **BEARISH** (📉): Predicted price < Current price
- **NEUTRAL** (➡️): Predicted price ≈ Current price

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Accuracy Factors:
- Market conditions change rapidly
- Model is based on historical patterns
- External events can affect stock prices
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

### Best Practices:
- Run predictions during market hours for most current data
- Consider multiple predictions over time
- Use as one of many analysis tools
- Always do your own research

### Limitations:
- Doesn't account for news events
- Doesn't consider market sentiment
- Based only on price/volume data
- No fundamental analysis included

## 🚀 Ready to Execute

Your prediction system is now ready! To get Apple's predicted stock price for tomorrow:
